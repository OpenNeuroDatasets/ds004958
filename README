The FreeSurfer Maintenance Dataset

This data was collected as part of the FreeSurfer Maintenance grant (FSM; R01EB023281) to support development and testing of FreeSurfer.  

The dataset contains the following scans:

- Anatomical
  - 12-echo gradient echo (GRE); magnitude and phase
  - MP2RAGE; both inversion contrasts, T1 map and uniform image
  - 4-echo MPRAGE with volumetric navigators (vNavs); magnitude, phase and RMS
  - T2-SPACE with volumetric navigators (vNavs)
- Diffusion
  - Multi-shell diffusion data
- Functional
  - 50-repetition resting state data
- Field Map
  - GRE phase-difference field maps
  - EPI blip-reversed field maps

Notes:

- All anatomical data was defaced with mideface (surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/MiDeFace)
- More details on how the dataset was curated is available at github.com/pwighton/fsm2bids/
